        <h2><li>Internet</li></h2>
            <p>The Internet is a place where we can access a worldwide system of interconnected networks.
                 These networks allow us to access a variety of data and media through different devices.</p>
        <h2><li> Web</li></h2>
            <p> It is a system of documents and resources that can be accessed through the internet.
                It is what we use when we want to browse online, stream videos, play online games, and use online applications. </p>
        <h2><li>How are the internet and Web different?</li></h2>
            <p> The internet is the infrastructure that allows us to connect to a network. 
                Meanwhile, the internet utilizes this infrastructure so we can use the applications and services to deliver and access content.</p>
        <h2><li>ASCII and Unicode</li></h2>
            <p>It is an encoding standard that uses a 7-bit code to represent 128 characters primarily in the English letters including numbers and symbols.
                On the other hand, Unicode is newer and more comprehensive as it can support encoding a wide range of characters from different languages.
            </p>
        <h2><li>What is UTF-8</li></h2>
            <p>UTF-8 or Unicode Transformation Format 8 is a character encoding system that uses 1 to 4 bytes. 
                Its space efficiency using only a few bytes allows it to be commonly used in many digital assets such as softwares, websites, and social media.
            </p>
        <h2><li>URL</li></h2>
            <p>URL also known as Uniform Resource Locator is an address that is unique to every web page, or a specific resource like an image or document.
                This also allows us to make navigation around the web a lot easier with just a click.
            </p>
        <h2><li>Domain Name</li></h2>
            <p>The Domain name is similar to a URL that points to an address of a specific website except it is easier to remember.
                 It is usually seen on top of the page that comes after www. or https:// </p>
        <h2><li>HTTP</li></h2>
            <p>HTTP or Hypertext Transfer Protocol is a set of communication rules used for transporting information between a client and a web server.
                Through this we are able to access information and interact with websites.
            </p>
        <h2><li>HTTPS</li></h2>
            <p>HTTPS or Hypertect Transfer Protocol Secure is similar to HTTP but with extra security.
                It encrypts all the communication between the browser and the website protecting sensitive information while browsing.
            </p>
        <h2><li>IP Address</li></h2>
            <p> An IP address is a unique address for each device that is connected to the internet.
                 It helps identify your device and allows it to send and receive data across the internet. </p>
        <h2><li>DNS</li></h2>
            <p> DNS or the Domain Name System functions like the phonebook of the internet.
                It looks up the domain name that you are looking for and translates it into machine readable IP addresses that can connect you to the website.
            </p>
        <h2><li>W3C Recommendations</li></h2>
            <p>W3C Recommendations provide a standard for all developers on how to build websites that can work properly on all devices.
                They make sure that websites are consistent and easy to use for everyone.
            </p>
        <h2><li>XML, XHTLML, HTML, HTML 5</li></h2>
            <p>XML is a flexible language for creating your own custom tags, while XHTML is a more rigid version of HTML that used XML rules.
                On the other hand HTML is the language used in building websites that uses tags to organize content.
                 Today we have HTML 5 which is the latest version of HTML that can support modern web technologies which is why it is preferred by most developers today.
