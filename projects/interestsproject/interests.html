          <h3> Recommended Books:</h3>
               <p><strong>1. Expect the Unexpected or you Wont Find it by Roger Von Oech</strong></p>
                    <p>A book considered as a "whack on the side of the head", it explores the teachings of Heraclitus. It dives deep into the philosophy of the self and how we can find ideas in the most unexpected places. I recommend this book to those who wants to learn how to think in different perspectives and understand the meaning of even the most mundane things. </p>
          
               <p><strong>2. The Daily Stoic by Ryan Holiday</strong></p>
                    <p> This book dives into the ancient philosophy of stoicism. It talks about the development of sel-control and a strong character. Each page contains a daily meditation that you can ponder upon before starting your day. I recommend this book to those who wants to study unique wisdom from the angle of stoicism.</p>
