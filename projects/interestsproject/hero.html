          <p> Heraclitus was an ancient greek from Ephesus. He was also called as <em>"the dark"</em> or <em>"the obscure"</em> because of his teachings that were usually cryptic and paradoxical using wordplay. His teachings were centered on the topic of change and finding unity in the opposites.Moreover, most of his teachings can be interpreted in different ways. The life of Heraclitus is not well documented and only a few of his works have survived. However, his works greatly influenced western philosphy.   </p>
