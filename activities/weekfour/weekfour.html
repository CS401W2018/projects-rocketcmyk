            <p id="numbertwo">2. What is the difference between an ID and a Class?</p>
                <p>- Although both are used to style elements within an HTML, an ID must be uniqu and should only be used on one element with a specific ID. Meanwhile, a class can be used on multiple elements on a page. </p>

                <p> - The div tag is used to create a style for a separate section or block within the page. Meanwhile the span tag can be used when you want to style a specific part or portion of a text with the use of inline elements.  </p>
            <p>4. What is the difference between a DIV tag and a HEADER, MAIN, or FOOTER?</p>
                <p><strong>A DIV tag</strong> is used as a container for structure and grouping. </p>
                <p><strong>A header</strong> represents the introduction of the page usually containing the company logo and title</p>
                <p><strong>The main tag </strong> contains the primary contents of the page.</p>
                <p><strong>The footer</strong>  contains the copyright information, contact details, sitemap, and other links to pages</p>
            <p>5. What are the different ways to select a color?</p>
                <p class="bolder">Some of the ways to select a color are the folowing: </p>
                <p><strong>Pre defined named colors</strong>, HTML recognizes a set of pre defined color names but only for simple colors</p>
                <p><strong>Hexadecimal Color Codes,</strong> using six digits that represents a color, more range of colors can be used</p>
                <p><strong>RGB Values,</strong>  it provides the same range of colors to hex code values except it uses a function where each value should contain a value from 0 to 255</p>
                <p><strong>HSL Values</strong>, its stands for Hue Saturation,a and Lightness. By using this it is easier to manipulate colors and create harmoniuos color palettes.</p>
                <p><strong>Color Picker,</strong>  by using a color picker, it is easier to select a color as a visual color picker will be provided, the value of the color is then turned into a hex code.</p>
