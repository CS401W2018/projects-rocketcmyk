        <h2> Questions:</h2>
            <p class="question">1. What kind of photos are good to encode using JPEG?</p>
                <p>JPEG is good for photos that are complex so that they can be compressed to a smaller size which means they can be loaded faster when using the internet. </p>
            <p class="question">2. What kind of photos are good to encode using GIF?</p>
                <p> Photos that are good for for GIFs are those that have limited color palettes and simple graphics and simple animation.</p>
            <p class="question">3. What is unique about the PNG format?</p>
                <p>PNGs use a lossless compression which means suring the compression, no image data is lost which is good for preserving details on the photo.</p>
            <p class="question">4. How do you resize your photo to the size it should be displayed?</p>
                <p>It could be resized using a photo editing software so that you can get the correct dimensions and size you would want to appear on your HTML file. You can also resizze an image using a css class</p>
            <p class="question">5. Why should you resize photos using photo editing software instead of resizing it using CSS?  </p>
                <p>Because resizing using css only changes the display size which means the file size remains the same. This could mean the browser would still take up the original data size in order to load the image which can make the website slow. By resizing it beforehand on the photo editor, the image can be optimized for its intended display size.</p>
