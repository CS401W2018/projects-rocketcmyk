        <h2> Questions</h2>
            <p class="q">1.The title and topic of your site. </p>
                <p> The title would be Evita's Art Space. It is a website and portfolio of my own artworks.</p>
            <p class="q">2. A brief paragraph about why you choose this topic.</p>
                <p>I chose this topic because I love making art and I want to share it to the world. I also thought it would be  a nice way to practice making my own portfolio using the skills I learned in HTML. I also would love to have my own platform for arts someday and help others get into a new hobby such as painting. </p>
            <p class="q">3. List out the content you will have on the home page and each of the five pages (one will have a table).</p>
                <p><b>Page 1 Home Page </b>- The homepage is where I can put my featured artworks, daily sketches, and some news and updates about the website and my artwork. <br>
                    <b>Page 2 Gallery</b>- This is where I would put up my best artworks as cards.<br>
                    <b>Page 3 Tutorials</b>- I will put images with links of art tutorials that I created and talk about the software that I use.<br>
                    <b>Page 4 Schedules </b>- This page is where I will put my theme schedule using a table. <br>
                    <b>Page 5 About</b> - About page is where I will put information about myself, about being an artist. 
                    </p>
            <p class="q">4. What fields (or information you will collect) will you put into your form? What data will go on your table?</p>
                    <p>In my form I will collect the email, names, address, and occupation of those who want to sign up for a newsletter. </p>
            <p class="q">5. How will you collect information/images/content for your site? You need at least 5 references on your site, list out at least 2 of references you plan on using.</p>
                <p>I will use my own illustrations for the images and I will use websites such as <a href=https://www.clipstudio.net/en>Clip Studio</a> and <a href=https://www.tate.org.uk/art/art-terms/d/digital-art>tate.org</a> for the information I will be putting in my website. </p>

            <p class="q">I will not use ChatGPT or another AI system to generate HTML, CS, or content on my page.</p>
